# Fabric Icons
Fabric icons, as we know are icon plugins developed by Microsoft team in a project called fluent design. The use of fabric is rarely used in the web, because it is a little less exspose by front end developers, but after some long dive on the internet, I found a way to use this object. Use the CSS link below :
```bash

```
```bash

```
